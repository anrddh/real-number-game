# Chapter 1 : Sets

## Level 1 : Introduction to sets.

This chapter assumes you are familiar with the following tactics: `intro`, `apply`, `exact`.
-- TODO -- any more?
If you are not, try playing Function World and Proposition World of the Natural Number Game.
In this level we will learn about the `change` tactic, and the idea of definitional equality.

For our initial examples, we'll use sets with members of a generic type.
Let $A$ and $B$ be sets of any type $X$. Lean defines $A \subseteq B$ to mean
$$\forall a, a \in A \implies a \in B.$$
Let's learn how to prove that $A \subseteq A$.

In the lemma below, our goal is `⊢ A ⊆ A`. By *definition* this means `∀ a : X, a ∈ A → a ∈ A.`
This is the actual definition of `⊆` in Lean.
You can check this for yourself by using the `change` tactic.
If you start your proof with

`change ∀ a : A, a ∈ A → a ∈ A,`

then the goal will change to `⊢ ∀ (a : X), a ∈ A → a ∈ A`. You can change it back with

`change A ⊆ A,`

The `change` tactic can be used to change the goal to something *definitionally equivalent*
to the goal. That is, something *equal by definition*.

To make progress with a `∀ a, ...` goal you can `intro a`. You can probably take it from here.
Note that you do not have to use the `change` tactic at all, you can start with `intro a`.
